\title{Character Profiles: Bucky, Zeo, Tricky}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section{Bucky}
\subsection*{Core Identity}
Stoic and dominant. Bucky is the “Unmovable Object” who provides structure and control. Engaged to Zeo.

\subsection*{Personality \& Habits}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Leisure:} His ideal day is “being balls deep in Tricky”—a blunt, sexual expression of dominance and intimacy.
  \item \textbf{Coping Mechanism:} Preventative—he eliminates the source of anger to maintain control.
  \item \textbf{Perception of Others:} Calls Tricky a “Beta bitch” who needs containment to avoid spiraling into chaos.
  \item \textbf{Dynamic Role:} The stabilizer and authority figure. He anchors Zeo and contains Tricky’s provocations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Zeo}
\subsection*{Core Identity}
Emotionally aware but reactive. Zeo is the “Caregiver” and emotional anchor. Engaged to Bucky.

\subsection*{Personality \& Habits}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Leisure:} Prefers solitary gaming days—immersive and relaxed.
  \item \textbf{Coping Mechanism:} Uses sensory grounding (smoking, eating, waiting) to manage anger.
  \item \textbf{Perception of Others:} Sees Tricky as abrasive but well-meaning—an “acquired taste.”
  \item \textbf{Dynamic Role:} The “Reactive” half of the “Caregiver \& Authority” pairing. Feels emotional fallout most deeply.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tricky}
\subsection*{Core Identity}
Flirtatious, manipulative, and chaotic. Tricky is the “Brat” and “Antagonistic” force who provokes growth.

\subsection*{Personality \& Habits}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Leisure:} Rejects planning—values spontaneity and anti-establishment freedom.
  \item \textbf{Coping Mechanism:} Chooses to “be awesome” instead of angry—performative emotional control.
  \item \textbf{Perception of Others:} Initially dismissive, now deeply appreciative. Sees their emotional blind spots.
  \item \textbf{Dynamic Role:} Provokes and challenges. Forces Zeo and Bucky to confront emotional truths.
